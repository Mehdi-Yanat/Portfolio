          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
           I'm Mehdi Yanat - a FullStack developer ,
           I have worked in tech and on the web for over 1 years with experience ranging from JavaScript, 
           CSS, Accessibility, Technical Writing
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
            enthused with making websites interactive.
            I love sharing and contributing to the tech community and it has become a significant part of my career. 
            I'm consistently engaging and advocating for open and inclusive developer communities and love sharing my knowledge and experience When I'm not coding, 
            you can find me geeking about vedio-editing, doing sports, and exploring or learning new skills
